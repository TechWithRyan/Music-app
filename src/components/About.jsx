      <section className='info-text'><p><h1>The journey</h1>I started my journey in web development 2020 by taking a 2 year course. I did have some basic knowledge from earlier high school classes 2007-2010. After graduating high school I got some work experience in event sales, scuffolding & customer service etc. Now im looking to land my first job as a web developer. I'm still learning and I'm excited to see where this new field of work will take me. </p>
        <br />
        <p><h1>Personal</h1>As a person I am friendly, easy going, driven and social. I enjoy learning and teaching as well. I normally find it easy in making new connections. I enjoy sports and being active. Also spending time with family and friends. I have been training ITF Taekwon-do when I was younger. Also volleyball and football. Now I'm going to the gym, jogging and go for walks with the dog. I also like music and play some guitar.

        <br />
        <p><h1>Learning</h1>My focus of learning right now are: React.JS, Databases & working with API's. I want to be able to build any type of website I want. I believe API's will help me doing this. I'm also looking into The Odin Project to learn more. I even have a mentor named Christer who is there to help me with my questions which I see as a major asset. I appreciate the patience.</p>
